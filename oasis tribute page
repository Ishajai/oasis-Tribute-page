        <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (10 December 1815 â€“ 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.</p>
        <p>Her notes on the engine include what is now considered to be the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Because of this, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.</p>
        <p>Ada Lovelace was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron and his wife Anne Isabella Milbanke ("Annabella"), Lady Wentworth.</p>
